PROJECT SUMMARY
This project was set out to implement and demostrate newly learnt back-end development methods of creating an API server using express.js as a framework. The project evolved from creating PSQL databases and using node-postgres to interact with the data and receive client requests and send responses. The project takes the form of a social board game review app whereby users can post reviews of categorised boardgames along with being able to comment on eachothers reviews. To request information from the server follow the link above and add different endpoints to receive specific information, for example: '/api/categories'.
